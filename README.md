# Tamagotchi-JAVA
This repository was created for personal use, primarily to share my code with friends. Feel free to use it for anything you'd likeâ€”I'm not particular about how it's used.
If you have any suggestions or feedback, or if you'd like to discuss anything, don't hesitate to reach out to me on Discord @darko4106.
If you need help with Java, want to learn more, or need guidance on how this project works, just let me know! I'll do my best to assist you. ðŸ˜Š
